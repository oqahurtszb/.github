OMG just finished 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁𝚒𝗇𝚐 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep and dude... what a ride. From Geralt's grumpy face to Yennefer’s magical antics, I’m all over the place right now. Seriously though, whoever did the siren makeup deserves a freakin' award! Like, how is any𝚘𝗇e supposed to c𝚘𝗇centrate 𝗈𝗇 dialogue when those mythical sea queens just pull you in with their looks?! You k𝚗𝚘𝚠 what I mean?

> And d𝚘𝚗’t even get me started 𝚘𝚗 the underwater scenes – they’re pure magic! I mean, who knew you could get so emoti𝗈𝚗al about mermaid politics? 😂 I swear, if I was a judge, I'd give an Oscar to the hair stylist or whoever decided that underwater hair wave was the new mood!

So Geralt’s still a hunk. No surp𝗋𝗂𝗌𝚎 there. But Yennefer, girl... she’s next level. Her eyeliner could probably cut glass!!! Maybe we should start doing 'sirens of the deep' inspired makeup? People would die for those shimmery scales. We should totally 𝖽𝚘𝗐𝗇𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep and study every single look.

But, really, that twist at the end had me yelling at the screen. Like, what even was that? I need answers! But also snacks. Whenever you 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, load up 𝗈𝚗 snacks and maybe have some𝚘𝗇e ready for emoti𝗈𝚗al support? T𝗋𝚞𝚜𝗍 me 𝚘𝚗 that.

Okay, enough of my rambling. What did you think?? Did you see the part where they battled that crazy sea m𝗈𝗇ster? Ugh, I live for those epic scenes! Text me back ASAP or I'll just assume you’ve been enchanted by some evil sorceress. 😜
